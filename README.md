# go-somfy-rts

The `go-somfy-rts` provides an simple implementation for generating somfy-rts protocol based waveforms.

## example implementation
since the code will be used on my `home assistant` base home automation, the executable can be used with an raspberry pi and an low budget [DEBO 433 RX/TX](https://www.reichelt.de/index.html?ACTION=446&LA=0&q=debo%20433%20rx%2Ftx)

## whats working
 
- shutter movement (up, down, my position / stop, program)
 
## ongoing progress
 
1) persistence to store rolling code
2) WebApp to manage shutters (e.g. CRUD operations) 
3) TLS
4) home assistant integration
